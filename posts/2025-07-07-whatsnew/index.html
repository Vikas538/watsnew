<h3 id="researchers-attempt-to-uncover-the-origins-of-creativity-in-diffusion-models"><a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/07/diffusion-model-creativity/?utm_campaign=infoq_content&amp;utm_source=infoq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_term=global">Researchers Attempt to Uncover the Origins of Creativity in Diffusion Models</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#researchers-attempt-to-uncover-the-origins-of-creativity-in-diffusion-models">#</a></h3>
<p>In a groundbreaking development, Stanford researchers Mason Kamb and Surya Ganguli have proposed a mechanism that explains the creativity of diffusion models, a key advancement for software developers and AI engineers working with generative models. The research suggests that creativity in these models is a deterministic consequence of their denoising process, which involves learning a score function to uncover images from noise.</p>
<p>The researchers identified two inductive biases, translational equivariance, and locality, in the models&rsquo; use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Translational equivariance refers to the model&rsquo;s tendency to reflect shifts in the input image, while locality arises from the CNNs considering only a small neighborhood of input pixels.</p>
<p>Building on these insights, they developed an Equivariant Local Score (ELS) machine, a mathematical model that optimizes a score function for equivariance and locality. The ELS machine showed remarkable accuracy in comparing its outputs with those of diffusion models such as ResNets and UNets trained on simplified models, achieving an accuracy of around 90%.</p>
<p>The study explains how diffusion models create new images by mixing and matching local training set image patches, offering insights into their creative process and potential errors. The researchers&rsquo; findings are significant because they provide the first analytical theory to explain a deep neural network-based generative model&rsquo;s creative outputs with such accuracy.</p>
<p>The researchers also shared the code they used in their study, opening up opportunities for further exploration of this intriguing area of AI and diffusion models. This research could form the foundation for studying more complex diffusion models, particularly those that incorporate self-attention layers.</p>
