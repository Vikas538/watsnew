A study led by the MIT Media Lab has shown that diffusion models, a type of AI model used for generating text, can also be applied to create original music and visual art. By training these models on vast datasets of creative works, they can generate new pieces resembling the styles they were trained on. This could revolutionize various creative industries by providing tools for quicker, more efficient content creation and potentially opening up new artistic possibilities.
