The article discusses a new approach to finding CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) security vulnerabilities in applications using CodeQL, GitHub's tool for querying code. Researchers have developed models that allow developers to identify potential issues within their frameworks. This is significant as CORS misconfigurations can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access. By utilizing these models, developers can proactively address vulnerabilities, enhancing the overall security of their applications.
