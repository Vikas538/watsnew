Article Summary:

A critical security vulnerability was announced in Git, a widely used open-source software for version control. The flaw (CVE-2021-3122) lies within the "git-pack-objects" command, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious objects into a repository during cloning or fetching operations. This vulnerability can lead to unintended code changes, data loss, or even unauthorized access. It affects Git versions 2.31.0 and earlier, and it's strongly recommended to update to the latest version (2.31.1) to mitigate the risk.
